# javafx8-minesweeper_executable
Repository for the executable .jar (Java Archive File) of the project hosted here https://github.com/kurushiidrive/javafx8-minesweeper
The purpose of making this separate is to make it easier to run the game without a specific development environment (JRE 8 is still required).

To run, type `java -jar minesweeper.jar` in Terminal or Command Prompt. Make sure the environment variables are properly set if using the latter.
