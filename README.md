# javafx8-minesweeper_executable
Repository for the executable .jar (Java Archive File) of the project hosted here https://github.com/kurushiidrive/javafx8-minesweeper
The purpose of making this separate is to make it easier to run the game without a specific development environment (JRE 8 is still required).

To run from Terminal or Command Prompt, set your working directory to be the same directory where the jar file is located, then type `java -jar minesweeper.jar`.
